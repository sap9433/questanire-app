      +" directly with Google Assistant, the search giant's voice-powered digital assistant. People can"
      +" say commands like, 'Hey, Google, preheat the oven to 425 degrees,' or ask, 'Hey, Google, are"
      +" my dishes clean?'"
      +"\n"
      +"The direct connection with Google Assistant removes the need to add an additional command"
      +" when talking to GE appliances. Previously, product owners had to use the Geneva Home Action"
      +" for voice commands, such as 'ey Google, ask Geneva Home to preheat the oven to 425"
      +" degrees.'"
      +"\n"
      +"The change works with GE Appliances' connected refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers and"
      +" washing machines, among other home appliances, all linked to the U+ Connect app to manage"
      +" the devices."
      +"\n"
      +"GE Appliances' closer integration with Google Assistant comes as the search giant vies with"
      +" Amazon for dominance in the market for smart home services. The direct connection with the"
      +" digital assistant could make GE home appliances slightly easier to use than with Alexa,"
      +" Amazon's digital assistant that has worked with GE products for the past couple of years."
      +" Amazon and GE in 2016 introduced a Geneva skill for Alexa that requires users say commands"
      +" such as, 'Alexa, tell Geneva to preheat the oven to 350 degrees,' per CNet. This additional step"
      +" may add some friction for users looking for a convenient method of controlling their kitchen's"
      +" smart devices."
      +"\n"
      +"GE Appliances' announcement comes as Electrolux, the Swedish maker of home appliances,"
      +" started integrating its connected kitchen products with Google Assistant. The voice integration"
      +" will begin in smart ovens next year, Electrolux announced last week. With more appliance"
      +" makers experimenting with connected home devices, the technology will continue to evolve and"
      +" grow increasingly sophisticated and easy to use for consumers."
      +"\n"
      +"The digital assistant and smart speaker space continues to heat up. Global shipments of"
      +" voice-powered smart speakers surged 278% to 9.2 million units in Q1 2018 from a year earlier."
      +" While Amazon shipped 4 million of those during the quarter, its market share slipped to 43.6%"
      +" from 81.8% year-over-year, according to Strategy Analytics. The worldwide smart home devices"
      +" market, comprised of smart speakers, digital media adapters, lighting, thermostats and other"
      +" connected gadgets like GE's appliances, is forecast to grow 26.8% this year to 549.5 million"
      +" total shipments, the International Data Corporation estimates."

      +" while expanding on Google's existing 'OK Google' voice controls."
      +"\n"
      +"Originally, Google Now smartly pulled out relevant information for you: it knew"
      +" where you work, and it knew your meeting locations and travel plans, the sports"
      +" teams you liked, and what interested you so that Now could present you with"
      +" personal information that mattered. Google has long killed the Google Now"
      +" brand, but Assistant very much lives in the same space, but fuses these personalised"
      +" elements with a wide-range of voice control"
      +"\n"
      +"The 'OK Google' or 'Hey, Google' side"
      +" covers voice commands, voice searching,"
      +" and voice-activated device control, letting"
      +" you do things like send messages, check"
      +" appointments and so on on your Android"
      +" device, just like Apple's Siri on an iPhone"
      +" or iPad, but reaching far beyond that, with"
      +" a bot-centric AI experience, designed to"
      +" give you conversational interactions."
      +"\n"
      +"Continued Conversation that means you"
      +" don't have to say 'Hey Google' for"
      +" follow-up requests. Google Assistant will"
      +" also work out when you're talking to it"
      +" versus other people in the room."
      +"\n"
      +"Multiple Actions is also a new capability"
      +" that enables you to ask for multiple things"
      +" at the same time. This, says Google, is"
      +" rather difficult - in linguistics it is called"
      +" coordination reduction. Mastering"
      +" requests like this is probably what will"
      +" power Google Assistant ahead of rivals."
      +"\n"
      +"Also, a new Pretty Please mode for Google"
      +" Assistant will help ensure everyone in"
      +" your household is saying 'please' and"

      +" positively when you say either of those"
      +" phrases."
      +"\n"
      +"Pretty Please can be enabled for specific"
      +" members of your household, so you can"
      +" encourage your kids to be polite, or you"
      +" can just play a trick on your spouse as"
      +" they're setting a timer for dinner without"
      +" their manners."
      +"\n"
      +"Because Google Assistant knows you and"
      +" understands context, it can react in an"
      +" informed or smart way. That's important"
      +" as Assistant spreads its wings, because it"
      +" gives voice control a lot more power and"
      +" moves it on from only reacting to specific"
      +" phrases or commands."
      +"\n"
      +"In the future, Google even says that"
      +" Assistant will be able to call and book"
      +" appointments for you."
